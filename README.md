# ECF-Payments-Analysis
A multi dashboard report built during my BI Visualization Internship at Evix (Kuwait) for a European client.

ECF Payments Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to the ECF Payments Analysis Dashboard project, developed during my Business Analyst internship with EVIX Consulting Kuwait. This dashboard was designed to provide a comprehensive, end-to-end view of the expense claims process for a European client.

Project Objective
The primary goal of this dashboard is to offer clear and actionable insights into the full claims lifecycleâ€”from submission, through processing, to final settlement. It empowers stakeholders to monitor claim status, analyze expense categories, identify process bottlenecks, and evaluate employee-level claim activity.

Dashboard Features

Overview: High-level metrics including total claims submitted, processed, and pending with corresponding amounts and processing rates.

Expense Analysis: Breakdown of total amount claimed by expense categories (e.g., Business Travel, Client Meetings, Business Lunch) and by location. Offers identification of the highest claiming categories and regions.

Process Monitoring: Tracks claims processing status over time including average processing days, pending claims, and longest pending claims by category and location.

Employee Point of View (POV): Highlights claims submitted and processed at the employee level, including top claimants and amount claims.

Insights: Data-driven takeaways such as dominant expense categories, regional claim trends, and areas requiring improved follow-up on pending claims.

Key Insights Derived
Successfully processed 91% of 345 claims worth over $724K, with an average processing time of 10 days.

Business Travel is the largest expense category accounting for $262K out of total claims.

Sweden leads in total claim value at $326K, with Italy and France also significant contributors.

Notable delays in claims processing found in Team Lunch and Client Meeting categories, some pending over 50 days.

Payment modes split nearly evenly between Payroll and Bank Transfer but pending amounts highlight opportunities for tighter tracking.

Technologies Used
The dashboard was created using industry-standard BI tools [specify if Power BI, Tableau, or others], incorporating interactive slicers and data visualizations to enhance user experience and analysis depth.
